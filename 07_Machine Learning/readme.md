# Machine Learning

This project dives into machine learning, employing a Workflow: Train-Test-Split method to construct a Supervised Learning model for predicting "Churn" data. 

"Churn" data represents the rate at which customers discontinue using UCI's telephone service, resembling real customer profiles.

Our model development unfolds across three key areas:

## 1. Generalized Linear Model (glm) Algorithm.
- Leveraging Supervised Learning for classification.
- Employing Resampling Techniques:
