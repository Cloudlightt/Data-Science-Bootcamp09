### Python Project Series: A Journey through Functional Projects
Welcome to a series of Python projects that will enhance programming skills. This series includes seven diverse projects, each designed to challenge and expand the capabilities in Python. Whether analyzing data, creating games, or diving into APIs, there's something here for everyone. Let‚Äôs explore each project in detail:

## 1. Final Project: Analyzing Sales Data of a Simulated Superstore  üìä


In this comprehensive project, you'll analyze the sales data of a simulated Superstore thorough analysis of sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.


## 2. Create a Game:  Rock Paper Scissors ‚úäüñêÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è


Build your own version of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors with basic game logic and control structures and simple bot to play against.

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming: Data Analyst üßë‚Äçüíª

Explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a data analyst class. This project covers:

- Defining classes and objects.
- Creating four essential functions for the Data Analyst class:

## 5. API Interaction: Star Wars Characters üåå

Pull and analyze data from the Star Wars API to explore characters from the iconic series. This project involves:

- Making HTTP requests to public APIs.
- Parsing JSON data.
- Creating and manipulating CSV files for data analysis.
- You‚Äôll retrieve data for 15 characters and prepare it for further analysis, blending creativity with coding.

## 6. Public API Retrieval: Rick and Morty üì∫

Extract and transform episode data from the Rick and Morty API into a CSV file. This project covers:

- Making HTTP requests to public APIs.
- Parsing JSON data.
- Creating and manipulating CSV files for data analysis.
- Discover interesting insights about the quirky universe of Rick and Morty through data.

## 7. Machine Learning: Predicting Customer Churn üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Dive into machine learning by predicting customer churn using a supervised learning model. This project includes:

- Preparing data using the train-test-split method.
- Building a model using logistic regression.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Working with Churn data, representing the rate at which customers leave UCI's telephone service. By the end, there is a predictive model for customer churn.
